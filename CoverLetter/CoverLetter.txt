Dear Sir or Madam,

Thank you for your precious time for reviewing my application!

I am a graduate student at Lehigh University major in Financial Mathematics and I am looking for a full-time entry-level job starting in May 2018.

My undergraduate university is Shanghai Jiao Tong University which is one of the most prestigious colleges in China, and I was major in Software Engineering and Finance. I think a compound background and skill set of programming, mathematics, and finance could make me outstanding in fields like quantitative analysis, risk management, model development and validation.

I have working experiences in relevant companies and positions: This summer, I worked in QuantConnet, a U.S. based Fin-Tech company, and I was in charge of quantitative analysis for trading strategies and risk management. Previously, I worked in Guotai Junan Securities, an investment bank in China, responsible for statistics arbitrage model development and validation. Before that, I worked as a summer intern in the Information Corporate Technology department of Morgan Stanley.

Yours faithfully,
