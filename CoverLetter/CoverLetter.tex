Thank you for your precious time for reviewing my application!

I am a graduate student at Lehigh University major in Financial Mathematics and I am looking for a full-time entry-level job starting in May 2018. 

My undergraduate university is Shanghai Jiao Tong University which is one of the most prestigious colleges in China, and I was major in Software Engineering and Finance. I think a compound background and skill set of programming, mathematics, and finance could make me outstanding in fields like quantitative analysis, risk management, model development and validation.

I have working experiences in relevant companies and positions: This summer, I worked in QuantConnet, a U.S. based Fin-Tech company, and I was in charge of quantitative analysis for trading strategies and risk management. Previously, I worked in Guotai Junan Securities, an investment bank in China, responsible for statistics arbitrage model development and validation. Before that, I worked as a summer intern in the Information Corporate Technology department of Morgan Stanley.

To learn more about myself, you are encouraged to visit my GitHub profile where you can see the projects I've done before as well as some academic research on financial markets.

\href{https://github.com/LiXiang618}{https://github.com/LiXiang618}

I am confident that I can offer you enough essential skills you are seeking. Feel free to call me at (669)~271-5090 to arrange an interview. Thank you for your time and I look forward to learning more about this opportunity!
